# nwg-shell

**nwg-shell** is a GTK3-based shell for [sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway) and 
[Hyprland](https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland) Wayland compositors. The project provides a common configuration tool 
(**nwg-shell-config**) that allows you to configure the system in a graphical UI, and a range of components such as 
**nwg-panel** (system panel), **nwg-drawer** (application launcher), **nwg-dock** (system dock), **nwg-menu** 
(XDG-style menu) or **nwg-bar** (customizable button bar). It also includes several native tools as 
**nwg-look** (look and feel GTK settings editor), **nwg-displays** (display configuration tool), **Azote** (wallpaper 
manager), **nwg-clipman** (clipboard history manager), **nwg-icon-picker** (icon browser with textual search), 
**nwg-readme-browser** (documentation viewer) and **nwg-hello** (login manager). Scripts and utilities such as 
**autotiling** (script for sway to automatically switch the horizontal / vertical window split orientation) and 
**gospuinfo** (a command to display system usage info) are used in the background. The shell also utilizes third party 
software as **swaync** (notification center), **gtklock** / **swaylock** (screen lockers) and more. The `nwg-shell` 
package itself acts as a metapackage and installer of default configuration files.
